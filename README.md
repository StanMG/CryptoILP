Hash Functions (SHA-256)

SHA-256 is the primary hashing algorithm in ILP. It produces a 256-bit (32-by) hash that's:
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces same output
- **One-way**: Cannot reverse a hash to find the input
- **Collision-resistant**: Extremely unlikely two inputs produce same hash
